        <h4>What you will need:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>25g fresh yeast</li>
          <li>200ml tepid whole milk</li>
          <li>400g white bread flour</li>
          <li>1tsp salt</li>
          <li>50g caster sugar</li>
          <li>115g softened, unsalted butter</li>
          <li>2 medium egg yolks</li>
          <li>1tsp vanilla extract</li>
          <li>75g candied citrus peel, finely chopped</li>
          <li>75g golden sultanas</li>
          <li>pinch of grated nutmeg</li>
          <li>2 tsp icing sugar, to dust</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Method:</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>Crumble yeast into small glass bowl and add the tepid milk. Mix the yeast until it dissolves and forms a smooth paste.</li>
          <li>Mix flour, salt and sugar in a large mixing bowl and make a well in the centre.</li>
          <li>Pour the yeast and milk mixture into the centre of the well and mix gently with a small amount of the flour mixture to form a smooth paste.</li>
          <li>Cover with a clean tea towel and leave at room temperature for 20 minutes until the paste forms a 'sponge' and is frothy and bubbling.</li>
          <li>Mix in the rest of the flour around the sides to form a stiff dough.</li>
          <li>Kneed the dough for about 10 minutes until smooth and elastic.</li>
          <li>Put the dough into a lightly oiled glass, china or plastic bowl which is big enough to let the dough double in size.</li>
          <li>Cover with a tea towel and leave to rise in cool room for about 1 and 1/2 to 2 hours, until doubled in size.</li>
          <li>Once it has risen, knock back and form it into a ball. Then let it rest for 5 minutes.</li>
          <li>Grease and line a deap 20cm round cake tin.</li>
          <li>Lightly dust work surface with a little flour and flatten the dough slightly.</li>
          <li>Spread butter over the top of the dough, put the egg yolks and vanilla extract in the middle and pile the fruit and nutmeg on top.</li>
          <li>Fold the sides of the dough over and carefully need until well blended. The mixture will be sticky until the ingredients are well mixed.</li>
          <li>Form into a ball by tucking outer dough into the centre and rotating in your hands. Then lower into the tin seam side down.</li>
          <li>Cover loosely with oiled clingfilm and set aside in a warm place for about an hour, until the middle of the dough is near the top of the tin.</li>
          <li>Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 200 degrees C.</li>
          <li>Cut a cross in the centre of the dough using a sharp knife about 1cm deep.</li>
          <li>Bake in the centre of the oven for 10 minutes then reduce the heat to 180 degrees C and bake for 45 minutes until golden and risen.</li>
          <li>Leave to cool then dust with icing sugar.</li>
        </ol>
