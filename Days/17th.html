        <h3>Fairytale of New York</h3>

        <p>It was Christmas Eve babe<br>
          In the drunk tank<br>
          An old man said to me, won't see another one<br>
          And then he sang a song<br>
          The Rare Old Mountain Dew<br>
          I turned my face away<br>
          And dreamed about you<br>
            <br>
            Got on a lucky one<br>
            Came in eighteen to one<br>
            I've got a feeling<br>
            This year's for me and you<br>
            So happy Christmas<br>
            I love you baby<br>
            I can see a better time<br>
            When all our dreams come true<br>
           <br>
           They've got cars big as bars<br>
           They've got rivers of gold<br>
           But the wind goes right through you<br>
           It's no place for the old<br>
           When you first took my hand<br>
           On a cold Christmas Eve<br>
           You promised me<br>
           Broadway was waiting for me<br>
           <br>
           You were handsome<br>
           You were pretty<br>
           Queen of New York City<br>
           When the band finished playing<br>
           They howled out for more<br>
           Sinatra was swinging,<br>
           All the drunks they were singing<br>
           We kissed on a corner<br>
           Then danced through the night<br>
           <br>
           The boys of the NYPD choir<br>
           Were singing "Galway Bay"<br>
           And the bells were ringing out<br>
           For Christmas day<br>
           <br>
           You're a bum<br>
           You're a punk<br>
           You're an old badword on junk<br>
           Lying there almost dead on a drip in that bed<br>
           You scumbag, you maggot<br>
           You cheap lousy homophobic slur<br>
           Happy Christmas your arse<br>
           I pray God it's our last<br>
           <br>
           The boys of the NYPD choir<br>
           Still singing "Galway Bay"<br>
           And the bells were ringing out<br>
           For Christmas day<br>
           <br>
           I could have been someone<br>
           Well so could anyone<br>
           You took my dreams from me<br>
           When I first found you<br>
           I kept them with me babe<br>
           I put them with my own<br>
           Can't make it all alone<br>
           I've built my dreams around you<br>
           <br>
           The boys of the NYPD choir<br>
           Still singing "Galway Bay"<br>
           And the bells are ringing out<br>
           For Christmas day</p>
