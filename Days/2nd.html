        <h4>Jingle Bells</h4>
        <p>
          [Verse 1]<br>
          Dashing through the snow<br>
          In a one-horse open sleigh<br>
          O'er the fields we go<br>
          Laughing all the way<br>
          Bells on bobtails ring<br>
          Making spirits bright<br>
          What fun it is to ride and sing<br>
          A sleighing song tonight<br>
          <br>
          [Chorus]<br>
          Jingle bells, jingle bells<br>
          Jingle all the way<br>
          Oh, what fun it is to ride<br>
          In a one-horse open sleigh, hey<br>
          Jingle bells, jingle bells<br>
          Jingle all the way<br>
          Oh, what fun it is to ride<br>
          In a one-horse open sleigh<br>
          <br>
          [Verse 2]<br>
          A day or two ago<br>
          I thought I'd take a ride<br>
          And soon, Miss Fanny Bright<br>
          Was seated by my side<br>
          The horse was lean and lank<br>
          Misfortune seemed his lot<br>
          He got into a drifted bank<br>
          And then we got upsot<br>
          <br>
          [Chorus]<br>
          Jingle bells, jingle bells<br>
          Jingle all the way<br>
          Oh, what fun it is to ride<br>
          In a one-horse open sleigh, hey<br>
          Jingle bells, jingle bells<br>
          Jingle all the way<br>
          Oh, what fun it is to ride<br>
          In a one-horse open sleigh<br>
          <br>
          [Verse 3]<br>
          A day or two ago<br>
          The story I must tell<br>
          I went out on the snow<br>
          And on my back I fell<br>
          A gent was riding by<br>
          In a one-horse open sleigh<br>
          He laughed as there I sprawling lie<br>
          But quickly drove away<br>
          <br>
          [Chorus]<br>
          Jingle bells, jingle bells<br>
          Jingle all the way<br>
          Oh, what fun it is to ride<br>
          In a one-horse open sleigh, hey<br>
          Jingle bells, jingle bells<br>
          Jingle all the way<br>
          Oh, what fun it is to ride<br>
          In a one-horse open sleigh<br>
          <br>
          [Verse 4]<br>
          Now the ground is white<br>
          Go it while you're young<br>
          Take the girls tonight<br>
          And sing this sleighing song<br>
          Just get a bobtailed bay<br>
          Two forty as his speed<br>
          Hitch him to an open sleigh<br>
          And crack, you'll take the lead<br>
          <br>
          [Chorus]<br>
          Jingle bells, jingle bells<br>
          Jingle all the way<br>
          Oh, what fun it is to ride<br>
          In a one-horse open sleigh, hey<br>
          Jingle bells, jingle bells<br>
          Jingle all the way<br>
          Oh, what fun it is to ride<br>
          In a one-horse open sleigh
